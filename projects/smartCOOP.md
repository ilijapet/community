## Project Name

SmartCOOP

## Category

Application

## Project Description

SmartCOOP tries to offer implementation of basic agricultural cooperative logic in the form of smart contracts. In this way we try to propose some possible solutions for problems individual agricultural producers confront while working inside of the traditional frame of cooperatives and big corporate buyers.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p

Beside attempting to implement basic business logic of agricultural cooperative through smart contract we would like to use IPFS for our dapp back end.

## Project Status
